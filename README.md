# RayTracing in Unity

Just having some fun with ray tracing in Unity. These are ran at quite low resolutions (720p) due to lack of GPU horsepower. 

## System Specification
Macbook Pro 2017 with AMD Radeon Pro 555 (2GB VRAM)

A scene with 4 spheres: red transparent, colourless transparent, purple diffuse, green mirror. Implemented a simple hack to create the light focusing effect when it passes through transparent spheres causing the middle of the shadow to light up.
